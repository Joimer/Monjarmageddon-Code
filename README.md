# Monjarmageddon-Code
The code for Monjarmageddon.

This is a copy of the code that runs [Monjarmageddon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/738030/Monjarmageddon/).
A substracted Input Manager can be found [here](https://github.com/Joimer/Unity-Input-Manager/).

It's unpolished after the pre-release crunch and a a couple of needed refactors were not done for this game release, but this code contains otherwise many examples on how things can work in a 2D platformer game for Unity.
